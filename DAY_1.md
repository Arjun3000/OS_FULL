✅ 1. What is an Operating System?
📘 Simple Explanation:
An Operating System (OS) is like a manager between your computer hardware (CPU, RAM, disk) and the software applications (like Chrome, Python, etc.).

🔧 OS Responsibilities:
Start and stop programs

Manage memory and storage

Handle files and directories

Manage input/output (keyboard, mouse, disk)

Enforce security (user logins, permissions)

Think of the OS as the brain of your system—it controls everything in the background.

🔐 Security Role:
Prevents unauthorized access to hardware and software

Logs user activity

Manages secure file access

✅ 2. Kernel vs Shell
⚙️ Kernel:
The core part of the OS.

Directly controls CPU, memory, devices.

Works in Kernel Mode (full control).

Handles System Calls from user applications.

📌 Examples:

Linux Kernel

NT Kernel (Windows)

💻 Shell:
Interface to communicate with the OS.

Can be command-line (like Bash, PowerShell) or GUI (Windows desktop).

Sends your instructions to the Kernel.

📌 Examples:

Bash (Linux)

Command Prompt / PowerShell (Windows)

🔐 Security Role:
Kernel enforces access control and isolation.

Shells can be abused by attackers to execute commands (e.g., reverse shell).

✅ 3. Types of OS Architectures
🧱 A. Monolithic Kernel
Everything (drivers, file system, memory) runs in one big program in kernel space.

Faster but less secure (bugs can crash entire system).

📌 Example: Linux

🧩 B. Microkernel
Only essential parts (like communication and scheduling) are in the kernel.

Other things (file systems, drivers) run in user space.

More secure, modular, but slower.

📌 Example: Minix, QNX

🔀 C. Hybrid Kernel
A mix of monolithic and microkernel features.

Balances speed and modularity.

📌 Example: Windows NT, macOS

🔐 Security Insight:
Smaller kernels (microkernel) = smaller attack surface.

Monolithic kernels = need extra care to manage privileges correctly.

✅ 4. System Calls and Their Role in Security
📞 What is a System Call?
It’s like asking permission from the OS.

Applications can't directly access hardware — they use System Calls to:

Read/write files

Connect to internet

Create processes

Allocate memory

📌 In Linux, common system calls: open(), read(), fork(), exec()

🛡️ Why Important in Security?
Malware often uses system calls to hide its actions.

Security tools like strace, auditd, or Sysmon monitor system calls to detect attacks.

Rootkits may hook system calls to hide files/processes.

✅ 5. User Mode vs Kernel Mode
🧍 User Mode:
Where normal applications (like browsers or games) run.

Cannot access hardware directly.

Safe: If a bug happens here, it won't crash the system.

👑 Kernel Mode:
Where the OS Kernel, drivers, and low-level processes run.

Full access to CPU, memory, devices.

Dangerous: Bugs or exploits here can lead to full system takeover.

🔐 Why It Matters:
Attackers always try to escape User Mode and get into Kernel Mode.

This is called Privilege Escalation.

Example: If malware reaches kernel mode, it can disable antivirus, hide files, control your device.
