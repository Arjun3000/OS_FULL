# 🛡️ 7-Day Core Operating System (OS) Course with Final Firewall Project

Welcome to your **7-day intensive OS course**! This course blends essential Operating System concepts with practical coding tasks, designed specifically for someone walking the path to **cybersecurity mastery**.

---

## 🎯 Course Objective
Equip you with a solid foundation in OS concepts that power system-level security, file access control, and memory management — and end with a **firewall mini-project** as a practical cybersecurity tool.

## 🗓️ Course Schedule

### 📅 Day 1: OS Fundamentals & Architecture
- What is an Operating System?
- Kernel vs Shell
- Types of OS: Monolithic, Microkernel, Hybrid
- System Calls and Their Role in Security
- User Mode vs Kernel Mode (Privileged Execution)

✅ **Practical Task**:
- Write a summary comparing **Windows Kernel vs Linux Kernel**.

🎓 **Outcome**: Understand how OS structure affects system-level security.

---

### 📅 Day 2: Process Management
- Process Life Cycle (New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated)
- PCB (Process Control Block)
- Context Switching
- Scheduling Algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority)

✅ **Code Task**:
- **C++ Simulation** of Round Robin Process Scheduling.

🎓 **Outcome**: Ability to analyze and monitor process behavior—essential for intrusion detection.

---

### 📅 Day 3: Memory Management
- Paging vs Segmentation
- Virtual Memory & Address Translation
- Page Replacement Algorithms (FIFO, LRU, Optimal)
- Memory Leaks & Thrashing

✅ **Code Task**:
- **Python Simulation** of LRU Page Replacement.

🎓 **Outcome**: Build understanding of memory control and its importance in **fileless malware detection**.

---

### 📅 Day 4: File System Internals
- File Metadata: Inodes, Directories
- File Allocation Methods (Contiguous, Linked, Indexed)
- Disk Scheduling (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN)
- Journaling & File Recovery

✅ **Code Task**:
- Design an SQL schema for a **simple file system index**.

🎓 **Outcome**: Learn how OS stores and secures file access; crucial for forensic analysis.

---

### 📅 Day 5: Security & Access Control
- Authentication vs Authorization
- User Roles (root/admin vs standard users)
- File & Directory Permissions (Linux `chmod`, Windows ACL)
- System Logs (Linux `/var/log/`, Windows Event Viewer)

✅ **Task**:
- Check and edit file permissions on a Linux or Windows system using CLI.

🎓 **Outcome**: Understand OS-level access control — a core concept in system hardening.

---

### 📅 Day 6: I/O and Device Management
- I/O Devices & Drivers
- Polling vs Interrupt-Driven I/O
- Direct Memory Access (DMA)
- Buffering, Spooling, and Caching

✅ **Code Task**:
- Simulate a simple I/O request queue using **Python** or **C++**.

🎓 **Outcome**: Recognize how malicious drivers or I/O hooks may exploit the OS.

---

## 🔥 Day 7: Final Project — Host-Based Firewall

### 🛠️ Description:
Build a **Python-based host firewall** that:
- Filters traffic based on **IP**, **Port**, and **Protocol**
- Stores rules in an **SQLite database**
- Logs accepted/blocked attempts
- (Optional) Includes a **basic HTML GUI**

### 📁 Files:
- `firewall.py`: Python logic
- `rules.db`: SQLite for rules
- `log.txt`: Logs of allowed/blocked traffic
- `index.html`: Optional UI for rule input

### 🧠 Key Concepts Covered:
- Packet filtering
- System calls (`socket`, `subprocess`)
- Access control and logging
- SQL integration for security tools

🎓 **Outcome**: Demonstrate OS + cybersecurity integration by deploying a working **host-based firewall**.
